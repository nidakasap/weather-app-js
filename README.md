## Description
This is a really simple weather app that allows users to check the current weather conditions of cities. 
Users can add up to three cities and view detailed weather information for each city, including temperature, weather description, and min/max temperature.

This project showcases the practical implementation of the fetch API to retrieve real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap. 
The asynchronous getWeatherData function demonstrates error handling, data parsing, and dynamic content update based on user input.

## Features
Add City: Users can add a city by entering the city name and pressing Enter. The app fetches live weather data from OpenWeatherMap API.

City Limit: Users can add up to three cities. If the limit is reached, they need to remove a city before adding another one.

City Details: For each city, the app displays the current temperature, weather description, and min/max temperature.

Delete City: Users can remove a city by clicking the delete icon on the city card.
